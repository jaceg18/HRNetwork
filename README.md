# HRNetwork

Neural Network with MNIST Dataset
  This project implements a simple Neural Network using the MNIST dataset to recognize handwritten digits. The MNIST dataset consists of 60,000 training examples and 10,000 testing examples of handwritten digits, with each image being 28x28 pixels.

The Neural Network uses supervised learning to train a model that maps the input image data to a label (0-9) representing the handwritten digit. The accuracy of the model is evaluated on a test set and the model can be improved by adjusting the hyperparameters such as the learning rate, number of hidden layers, and number of neurons in the hidden layers.

Getting Started
  These instructions will help you set up the project on your local machine and use the code to train and evaluate the Neural Network.

Prerequisites
  Java 1.8 or later
  Java Integrated Development Environment (IDE) such as Eclipse or IntelliJ IDEA
  Installing
  Clone the repository to your local machine.
  Open the project in your IDE.
  Add the MNIST dataset to the project, you can download the dataset from here.
  Update the file path in the code to point to the location of the dataset on your machine.
  Running the code
  Run the Main class as a Java application.
  The code will train the Neural Network on the training data and evaluate its accuracy on the test data.
  Hyperparameter tuning
  The Neural Network's performance can be improved by adjusting the following hyperparameters:

  Learning rate: controls the step size for weight updates during training
  Number of hidden layers: determines the complexity of the model
  Number of neurons in hidden layers: determines the size of the model
  Experiment with different hyperparameters to find the best configuration for your problem.
