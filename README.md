# MNIST-Network
MNIST-Network is a Java program that trains a Neural Network made from scratch to recognize handwritten digits using the MNIST dataset.

## Getting Started
To get started with MNIST-Network, follow these steps:

- Clone the repository using git clone https://github.com/jaceg18/MNIST-Network.git.
- Open the project in your preferred Java IDE.
- Run the program.
## Usage
By default, the program trains the neural network using the MNIST training data and evaluates its performance on the MNIST test data. The program outputs the accuracy of the neural network on the test data.

You can also customize the neural network architecture and training parameters by modifying the program files. Here are some of the key parameters you can adjust:

- inputSize: The size of the input images (28 x 28 pixels for the MNIST dataset).
- hiddenSize: The number of hidden neurons in each hidden layer.
- outputSize: The number of output neurons (10 for the MNIST dataset).
- learningRate: The learning rate for the gradient descent algorithm.
- numEpochs: The number of training epochs.
- batchSize: The batch size for each training iteration.
### Results
The program outputs the accuracy of the neural network on the MNIST test data after training. The accuracy achieved may vary depending on the neural network architecture and training parameters used.
