MNIST Network
A handmade neural network implementation for the MNIST handwritten digit classification task in Java.

Getting Started
These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

Prerequisites
To run this project, you will need a Java Development Kit (JDK) installed on your machine.

Installing
Clone the repository to your local machine using the following command:
- git clone https://github.com/jaceg18/MNIST-Network.git
Navigate to the project directory and compile the source code:

- javac Main.java
Run the compiled class file:

- java Main.java
Using the MNIST Network
The MNIST Network takes the 28x28 grayscale images of handwritten digits as inputs and outputs the digit class (0-9) with the highest probability. The network architecture and hyperparameters can be adjusted in the MNIST.java file.
